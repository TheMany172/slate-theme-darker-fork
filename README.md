## Slate Theme

A theme with darker shady grey and darker mossy green highlights.

Inspired by and compatable with the incredible [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/)

Really liked slate-theme (https://github.com/yithian/slate-theme) all credit to yithian. I just wanted it a little darker. May amend the 'darkness' in the coming days/weeks.
